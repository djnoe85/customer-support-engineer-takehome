Things started out pretty smoothly. 

I followed the first five steps with virtually no issues except for two minor things. The first holdup was when I pasted "gatsby develop" into terminal and it didn't work because I was missing some dependencies. The second setback happened when I tried to deploy the site using Netlify and it failed. I spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out what happened before I decided to simply "retry deploy" and for some reason it worked.

Then things got a bit more interesting.
